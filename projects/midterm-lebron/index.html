        <p><mark><em>LeBron haters should stop reading now.</em></mark></p>



        <p>Despite being a team sport, some NBA teams <br>rely on a star to get them to the finals more <br>than
            others. Did
            Giannis
            do it without help? <br><em>Not really.</em> Did MJ carry Pippen? <em>Sometimes.</em> Is <br>LeBron
            amazing? Yes.
        </p>
        <p>There are plenty of opinionated articles and <br>videos debating this already. So I figured I <br>would
            add my
            data-driven take to the mix. What <br>do the data say about ranking the biggest <br>Finals carry jobs in
            NBA
            history?
        </p>
        <p>The data say that LeBron’s (losing) effort <br>with the 2018 Cavaliers reigns supreme.</p>

        <p>Artistic interpretation of LeBron James carrying Kyle <br>Korver. Other teammates not pictured, but also
            carried.</p>


        <p><mark><em>Advanced stat haters should stop reading.</em></mark></p>


        <p>To answer this I used the all-in-one advanced <br>stat <a href=" https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-our-raptor-metric-works/
            538: https://fivethirtyeight.com/"> RAPTOR WAR</a> (WAR) created by
            538, a good <br>measure for how many
            wins a player contributed <br>vs. what a replacement level player would. But <br>we can’t just measure
            who had
            the
            highest WAR <br>in isolation since both games and minutes played <br>factor in. It needs to be relative
            to the
            rest<br> of
            the team.</p>



        <div class="container">
            <div class="row align-items-center">
                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <p>This chart shows a player's WAR in the playoffs vs. <br>their minutes played for
                        every team in the
                        NBA finals <br>since 1997. Players with more uniform impact are <br>clustered closer
                        together, and those
                        with standout <br>performances are higher and more separated.</p>
                    <p>The <a href="#"><mark>2005 Pistons</mark></a> represents the "no 'I' in team" philosophy.
                    </p>
                    <p>The <a href="#">1998 Bulls</a> and the <a href="#"><mark>2020 Lakers</mark></a> are prime
                        examples of
                        a
                        dynamic duo.</p>
                    <p>And finally we have Duncan leading the <a href="#"><mark>2003 Spurs</mark></a>, Wade with
                        <a href="#"><mark>2006
                                Heat</mark></a>,
                        and
                        LeBron basically every year, but notably with the <a href="#"><mark>2018 Cavs</mark></a>
                        representing the single-handed carry jobs.
                    </p>

        <p>To rank the biggest carry jobs, I decided to look <br>at the WAR share among the top three players on a <br>team.
            I
            could’ve picked any number of players to <br>compare, but most great teams have at least two <br>or three stars,
            with
            the rest filling in as role <br>players, so three is the magic number.</p>

        <section>
            <p>LeBron was just so good in Miami that even with other stars his numbers were crazy</p>

            <p>Dirk’s final run is often cited as a carry job, but the data prefer his first appearance</p>
            <p>The biggest surprise here as Hakeem’s first title usually sits atop most lists</p>
            <p>Less minutes for Giannis and some stellar support put this in the bottom</p>
        </section>
        <!--END GRAPHICS TEXT-->
        <p>To summarize: the data say that LeBron is Mr.<br> Playoffs, and some of the most epic carry jobs <br>were
            done by
            finals
            losers, who maybe just <br>needed one more piece to the puzzle to win it all. <br>But mostly, this is
            another
            <br>perspective to add to these on-going debates.</p>

        <!--FOOTER TEXT-->
<hr>
        <p>Data for this story came from 538. The analysis only <br>included players with 150+ minutes played. There
            are
            a lot<br>
            of metrics out there, and they can all be great <br>and terrible. Quantity matters in the playoffs, so a<br>
            cumulative
            stat was chosen.</p>
