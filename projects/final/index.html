    <h1>When will the Baltimore Orioles <br>be competitive again?</h1>
    <img src="img/mounty.jpeg" alt="Ryan Mountcastle" width="700" height="450">

    <p>


        The Baltimore Orioles have been a somewhat non-competitive baseball team for the past 20 seasons,<br> besides a
        six-year span from 2012-2016 that saw them reach the postseason three times and win the<br> American League East
        division in 2014. Since the 2017 season, the Orioles have had the worst record <br>in the MLB twice and the
        second
        worst once. </p>
    <p>This has caused many fans, writers, and executives across the league to take a step back and
        look at
        how <br>non-competitive this team has been. Since the 2019 hiring of Mike Elias as the executive vice president
        and<br>
        general manager of the team, the Orioles have been looked at as a team that will eventually contend in<br>
        upcoming
        years. Elias is known best for digging the Houston Astros out of a similar hole and leading them to a <br>World
        Series championship in 2017 through the draft and his ability to groom young talent.
    </p>
    <h2>Let’s look at how Elias can do the same thing in Baltimore.
    </h2>
    <p>The Orioles were one of the MLB’s best teams from 2012-2016, leading the league in home runs in 2012, 2014, and
        2016. </p>
    <p>Here's a look at the league leaders in home runs from the first year the Orioles made the playoffs until this
        past season.</p>
    <h2>League leaders in home runs 2012-2021</h2>
    <p><img src="img/mlbhrleaders.png" alt="home run leaders"></p>
    <p>As you can see, the Orioles had a player lead the league in home runs from 2013-2017</p>
    <p>After starting 32-75 in 2018, they had a fire sale at the trade deadline and blew the team up,<br> trading Manny
        Machado, Jonathan Schoop, Kevin Gausman and multiple other players for prospects. <br>
    <p>They then hired Mike Elias in
        the offseason to come rebuild this team.</p>
    <p>Since joining the Orioles in 2019, Elias has conducted a complete overhaul of the team, on the field and off
        it.<br>

        Elias is best known for his turnaround of Houston, taking them from worst to first in five plus seasons. His use
        <br>of analytics and hiring tactics were unheard of back when he took over in Houston in 2012, but as we’ve
        seen<br>
        over the recent years with Tampa Bay, they have become very prominent.
    </p>

    <p>As far as the Orioles are concerned, it looks like there is a lot <br>to be excited about for the future in
        Baltimore. </p>
    <h2> Orioles top-15 prospects</h2>
    <img src="img/prospectlist.png" alt="orioles top-15 prospects">
    <p>These 15 players are just the beginning of what is to come over the next few years in Baltimore, <br>as their
        lack of
        spending in free agency and draft selections are finally seeming like they will pan out as planned. </p>
    <p>As far as the present is concerned, there is a little less to be excited about. </p>
    <h2>Orioles 2021 hitting leaders</h2>
    <img src="img/battingstats.png" alt="orioles 2021 hitting stats">
    <p>Players like Ryan Mountcastle, Cedric Mullins and Trey Mancini had great years statistically<br> and led the team
        in
        most offensive categories, but the productivity pretty much stops there.<br></p>
    <p>These main producers are in the future
        plans of the Orioles (so it seems) and will open the door for<br> prospects like Adley Rutschman, Gunnar
        Henderson
        and Colton Cowser to shoot through the minor leagues and into<br> Baltimore to provide them help as soon as
        possible.</p>

    <p>As far as pitching goes, there is a little more work to be done. </p>

    <h2>Orioles 2021 pitching statistics</h2>
    <img src="img/pitchingstats.png" alt="orioles 2021 pitching">
    <p>Aside from John Means -- who has been in trade talks recently -- there is not much to be excited about <br>on the
        mound for the Orioles. Luckily, the farm system has some great young arms that will be making their debuts<br>
        very
        soon. </p>
    <p>Guys like Grayson Rodriguez and D.L Hall are looked at as pitchers who can make an impact as soon as 2021
        or 2022. </p>
    <h2>The Future</h2>
    <p>There has been a lot of talk about the future for the Orioles, and for good reason. The recipe to success<br> is
        right in front of them and a proven leader is at the helm to guide them through it. As long as they can develop
        <br> this talent, keep them healthy, and spend some money, the Orioles are going to be a team that contends very
        soon.
    </p>
    <h2>Let's hope to see more moments like this in 2022 and beyond</h2>
