        <h1>When will the Baltimore Orioles <br>be competitive again?</h1>
        <img src="img/mounty.jpeg" alt="Ryan Mountcastle" width="700" height="450" class="img-fluid">

        <p>


            The Baltimore Orioles have been a somewhat non-competitive baseball team for the past 20 seasons, besides a
            six-year span from 2012-2016 that saw them reach the postseason three times and win the American League East
            division in 2014. Since the 2017 season, the Orioles have had the worst record in the MLB twice and the
            second
            worst once. </p>


        <p>This has caused many fans, writers, and executives across the league to take a step back and
            look at
            how non-competitive this team has been. Since the 2019 hiring of Mike Elias as the executive vice president
            and
            general manager of the team, the Orioles have been looked at as a team that will eventually contend in
            upcoming
            years. Elias is known best for digging the Houston Astros out of a similar hole and leading them to a World
            Series championship in 2017 through the draft and his ability to groom young talent.
        </p>

        <h2>Let’s look at how Elias can do the same thing in Baltimore.
        </h2>
        <p>The Orioles were one of the MLB’s best teams from 2012-2016, leading the league in home runs in 2012, 2014,
            and
            2016. Here's a look at the league leaders in home runs from the first year the Orioles made the playoffs
            until this
            past season.</p>
        <h2>League Leaders in Home Runs 2012-2021</h2>
        <img src="img/mlbhrleaders.png" alt="home run leaders" class="img-fluid">
        <p>As you can see, the Orioles had a player lead the league in home runs from 2013-2017.</p>
        <p>After starting 32-75 in 2018, they had a fire sale at the trade deadline and blew the team up, trading Manny
            Machado, Jonathan Schoop, Kevin Gausman and multiple other players for prospects.
        <p>They then hired Mike Elias in
            the offseason to come rebuild this team.</p>
        <p>Since joining the Orioles in 2019, Elias has conducted a complete overhaul of the team, on the field and off
            it.

            Elias is best known for his turnaround of Houston, taking them from worst to first in five plus seasons. His
            use
            of analytics and hiring tactics were unheard of back when he took over in Houston in 2012, but as we’ve
            seen
            over the recent years with Tampa Bay, they have become very prominent.
        </p>

        <p>As far as the Orioles are concerned, it looks like there is a lot to be excited about for the future in
            Baltimore. </p>
        <h2> Orioles Top-15 Prospects</h2>
        <img src=" img/prospectlist.png" alt="orioles top-15 prospects" class="img-fluid">
        <p>These 15 players are just the beginning of what is to come over the next few years in Baltimore, as their
            lack of
            spending in free agency and draft selections are finally seeming like they will pan out as planned. </p>
        <p>As far as the present is concerned, there is a little less to be excited about. </p>
        <h2>Orioles 2021 Hitting Leaders</h2>
        <img src="img/battingstats.png" alt="orioles 2021 hitting stats" class="img-fluid">
        <p>Players like <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/mountry01.shtml" target="_blank">Ryan
                Mountcastle</a> , <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/mullice01.shtml"
                target="_blank">Cedric Mullins</a> and <a
                href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/mancitr01.shtml" target="_blank">Trey Mancini</a> had
            great years statistically and led the team
            in
            most offensive categories, but the productivity pretty much stops there.</p>
        <p>These main producers are in the future
            plans of the Orioles (so it seems) and will open the door for prospects like Adley Rutschman, Gunnar
            Henderson
            and Colton Cowser to shoot through the minor leagues and into Baltimore to provide them help as soon as
            possible.</p>

        <p>As far as pitching goes, there is a little more work to be done. </p>

        <h2>Orioles 2021 Pitching Statistics</h2>
        <img src="img/pitchingstats.png" alt="orioles 2021 pitching" class="img-fluid">
        <p>Aside from John Means -- who has been in trade talks recently -- there is not much to be excited about on the
            mound for the Orioles. Luckily, the farm system has some great young arms that will be making their debuts
            very
            soon. </p>
        <p>Guys like Grayson Rodriguez and D.L Hall are looked at as pitchers who can make an impact as soon as 2021
            or 2022. </p>
        <h2>The Future</h2>
        <p>There has been a lot of talk about the future for the Orioles, and for good reason. The recipe to success is
            right in front of them and a proven leader is at the helm to guide them through it. As long as they can
            develop
            this talent, keep them healthy, and spend some money, the Orioles are going to be a team that contends very
            soon.
        </p>
        <h2>Let's hope to see more moments like this in 2022 and beyond</h2>
