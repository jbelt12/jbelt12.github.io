                <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>




                <p>I am a 21-year-old student in the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the
                    University of Maryland, College
                    Park. I grew up living in Laurel, Maryland and have lived there my entire life. I have two older
                    sisters that
                    are 27 and 24 years old, and we are very close siblings. I played sports throughout my childhood and
                    through
                    high school, with basketball and baseball being the ones that I went the furthest in. I had a
                    chance to play
                    baseball at the collegiate level, but in the end it didn't work out. Although my competitive
                    playing days are likely over, that still hasn't stopped my love for sports in general. My goal
                    is to work in
                    sports, although the details of what I would like to do have yet to be determined.
                    I have worked in sports for about two years, being a contributing writer for a college
                    basketball website as well as interning for the University of Maryland's Media Relations program.
